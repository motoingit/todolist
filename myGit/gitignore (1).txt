                                    # Explanation:
# To ignore all .exe or .txt files, you add the lines *.exe and *.txt to your .gitignore file.
# The asterisk (*) acts as a wildcard, which means "match any sequence of characters." So, *.exe will match any file that ends with the .exe extension, regardless of its name.
