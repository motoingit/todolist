This is a **classic Git error** — nothing to panic about 🚀. Let’s decode it:

---

### 🔎 What the error means

* Your **local branch (`main`) is behind the remote branch (`main`)** on GitHub.
* In simple words: someone (or maybe you from another PC) has already pushed commits to GitHub that your local repo doesn’t have.
* Git prevents you from overwriting history by default.

---

### ✅ How to fix

You have two main options:

---

#### **Option 1: Pull first (recommended if you want to keep remote changes)**

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

* `git pull --rebase` updates your local branch with the remote commits *without creating messy merge commits*.
* After that, you can push normally.

---

#### **Option 2: Force push (⚠️ overwrites remote history)**

Only use this if you are **sure** your local code should completely replace what’s on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

⚠️ Warning: This will delete the remote’s newer commits if they exist. Bad if you’re working with others.

---

### 💡 Why it happened

* You cloned the repo earlier and forgot to `git pull`.
* You edited directly on GitHub (like README changes).
* You’re working on multiple systems and forgot to sync.

---

👉 Recommended for you (since you’re solo on this project, I think):
Run:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

Do you want me to explain **step-by-step what happens during that `git pull --rebase`** so you know exactly what Git is doing under the hood?
