Yes ðŸ˜„ â€” you are correct:

The command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

is indeed a **valid and often safer way** to install dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file.

### Why itâ€™s better than just `pip install -r requirements.txt`:

* Ensures you are using the **pip version associated with your current Python interpreter**.
* Avoids errors in environments with multiple Python versions.
* More reliable for virtual environments.

So yes â€” **this is the correct and recommended command**, especially when working with virtual environments or multiple Python versions.

If you want, I can now give you a **quick mini-guide on generating your own `requirements.txt`** so you can share/install dependencies easily in any project.
