Exactly ðŸ˜„ â€” youâ€™ve got it.

Hereâ€™s the relationship clearly:

| Command                     | Meaning                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pip install opencv-python` | Installs the **OpenCV Python package** into your environment. This package includes the `cv2` module. |
| `import cv2`                | Imports the module installed by the above command so you can use it in your Python code.              |

### Why theyâ€™re different

* `pip install opencv-python` â†’ **installs** the package into your environment.
* `import cv2` â†’ **uses** the package in your Python code.

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:
Think of `pip install opencv-python` like buying a toolbox and bringing it into your workspace.
`import cv2` is taking a tool from the toolbox and using it.
