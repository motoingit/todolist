Hereâ€™s the role of each key component and their dependencies:

app.py (The Brain & Engine):

Role: This is the main application file. It contains the Flask server logic, defines routes (URLs), and handles interactions with the SQLite database.

Dependencies: It depends on the templates/ folder to render HTML pages and the static/ folder to serve CSS/JS/images. It also creates/uses the instance/todo.db file.

templates/ (The View / UI):

Role: Contains all your HTML files, which are enhanced with Jinja2 templating syntax. base.html is a layout template that others (index.html, about.html, update.html) extend to avoid code repetition.

Dependencies: These files are rendered by app.py. They are useless without the Flask server to process the Jinja2 tags and send the final HTML to the user's browser.

static/ (The Styling & Interactivity):

Role: Houses all static assets that don't change.

css/style.css: Styles your HTML (colors, layout, fonts).

js/test.js: Adds client-side interactivity to your web pages.

1.png: An image used on the site.

Dependencies: These files are referenced by your HTML files in the templates/ folder. The browser requests them separately after receiving the HTML.

instance/todo.db (The Memory):

Role: This is your SQLite database file. It stores all the tasks for your To-Do app.

Dependencies: It is created and written to/read from by app.py. The app is entirely dependent on this file to persist data.

In a nutshell: A user visits a URL -> app.py handles the request -> it might read/write from todo.db -> it picks an HTML file from templates/ and renders it -> that HTML tells the browser to load the CSS/JS from static/ -> the user sees a styled, interactive page.
